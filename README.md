# AI Code completion model (and metrics for this task) review 

Note: I recommend to view Cpp_functions_predictions.ipynb as this file contains all the code and comments to this project. Moreover, it is advised to view (and potentially) run this file in google colab.

In this project I will use bigcode/starcoder2-3b for C++ code completion. As I have some experience in competitive programming, I will try to measure the accuracy of predicting correctly the body of some algorithm related functions (such as bfs, dijkstra, turbomatching).
